# Photo-Diary

Photo Diary is a social media-style web application where users can upload, share, and interact with photos within a virtual diary. This project was developed as part of a collaborative final for CSCI 201 and showcases both front-end and back-end development skills. Users can tag photos with geolocations, view interactive maps, and control privacy settings, allowing for a personalized and secure photo-sharing experience.

Key Features:
- Geolocation & Maps: Users can tag their photos with specific locations, and posts are displayed on an interactive map using the Leaflet and OpenStreetMap APIs.
- User Authentication: Secure login system with MySQL for user data storage, supporting both guest browsing and authenticated user features like creating, editing, and privacy controls for posts.
- Dynamic User Interface: Front-end built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allowing users to like, share, and interact with posts through a sleek and responsive UI.

Technical Details:
- Backend: Implemented using Java with multithreaded servlets, ensuring seamless interaction across multiple clients. Data, including posts and users, is stored in MySQL.
- Frontend: Developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Integrated geolocation and map-based views allow users to pin photos to specific locations on the interactive map.
- Database Management: Stored user information and media securely in MySQL, using BLOBs for image data and managing user relationships (friends, posts) efficiently.

Project Highlights:
- Multithreading: Enabled smooth performance with multiple users interacting with the platform simultaneously through multithreaded servlets.
- Networking: Hosted on a Tomcat server, supporting dynamic interaction across multiple devices.
- Collaboration: The project was managed using GitHub for version control, allowing efficient teamwork across various development environments.

My Role:
- While I contributed to both the front and back end of this full-stack project, my primary focus was on the front-end development. I created an intuitive and dynamic user interface that integrates seamlessly with the backend, ensuring a smooth and engaging experience for users. This project highlights my ability to build scalable, user-friendly applications by combining modern web technologies, APIs, and SQL-based data management, in a collaborative environment.
